A forum demo
==========================
##### Introduction
This Application is a sample forum bases on ruby on rails, but the rails version is too **old** to reference, maybe it will be updated oneday.

And this's my first rails program, referred to [Ruby on Rails](http://railstutorial-china.org/book/) for **Chinese version**.
Just a sample App with many bugs, if you want the integrated [Code](https://github.com/mhartl/sample_app_3rd_edition)
